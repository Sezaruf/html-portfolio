 <h1>The Best Movies According To Cesar</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>Society Of Snow</h3>
<p>One of my favorite movies. A plane crashes at 11.700 feet in the Andes on October 13 of 1972. Show the sacrifice of this survivors and what they had to do in order to survive. </p>
<h3>The Godfather 2</h3>
<p>I love mob movies, this one in particular shows the past of Don Vito Corleone and I really loved De Niro and Al Pacino's acting skills.</p>

<h3>Deadpool And Wolverine</h3>
<p>It might not be the greatest piece of art when it comes to cinematography, but it is a really funny movie and a collab that a lot of people (me included) has been waiting for.</p>
